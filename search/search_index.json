Corollary \u00b6 Always manufacture prototype and production designs on the same tooling - always . Overview \u00b6 This site hosts the ZeroDiff process documentation. It captures knowledge that small teams can use to produce high-value objects at low-to-medium volumes. The process is similar to the design and development of modern software: build an MVP and then rapidly iterate design and development. Every iteration, e.g. a github commit, \"goes live\" with real users in order to perform value testing. This process repeats for an ever-growing user base on an ever-growing product value. The current consensus is that it takes 15 product design iterations to reach maximal user value, so if you want to estimate when your design will reach its optimal mass-production utility, then multiply your iteration cycle time by 15. Kill the Waterfall Method (Again!) \u00b6 i.e. Crowdsource, Works-Like/Looks-Like, Shenzhen \u00b6 Prior to the 2000s, software development followed a processed called The Waterfall Method. Product development would follow a sequence: conception, analysis, design, construction and testing. 12-18 months might pass before users saw anything, and if they wanted changes or didn't like features, it might be another 12-18 months before they would see those changes. It was pretty awful, and no good software product designer would ever want to go back to those times. Today, software developers follow a lean or agile practice that involves small, rapid iterations with continual and close user-value testing. Each iteration allows for incremental investments targeted toward value and user growth. So why are hard goods designers stuck in the Waterfall Methodology? Setting aside the debate of just how easy/cheap it is to fly to Shenzhen to engage a fab/CMS in supply chain execution, there are two major problems with this approach: The team is working toward a single manufactured revision given imperfect user testing - a kind of Hail Mary pass. The product users are somewhere else, so for the factory design team, user empathy is low. The whole point of ZeroDiff is to rapidly iterate with the users close at hand. Maybe you build ten of the first version and get them into the hands of real users. This allows the product design team to evaluate the user experience and propose design changes that show up in the next iteration within 1-2 weeks. Each successive iteration grows the product value, and potentially grows the user base. Since every revision is production-ready, the development team can select any revision for mass production. At that point, if your demand is high and you need MoQ 10K production runs then it's super simple to take your latest rev to Shenzhen. The rest of us (most of us) can continue to produce economically in low-volume close to where we live. Permission-based Production is Terrible \u00b6 As small-batch production become less economically viable, product design teams find themselves in a permission-based production model where they have to convince a fab or CMS of the value of their job over other jobs. Most modern fabs will quickly design prototypes and produce samples in order to win larger business later, but they will not run those designs at low volume unless there's no other work on the line. To make things worse, the production-version designs and fab/assembly docs are generally not accessible to the product design team, making it painful and expensive to switch fabs. The Joys of High-Value at Low-Volume \u00b6 A side-effect of the ZeroDiff process is that small-batch production is something you can do economically on short development cycles and low unit volume. \"Value\" is a complex word, but in production we tend to boil it down to simple economics. What happens when an object's cost or sales price is not a major component of its value? That gives us the luxury to chose the many other definitions of value. Perhaps we can choose to make things because they increase our enjoyment, or relieve the suffering of others.

Prior to 2011 I knew nothing about electrical, hardware or radio engineering. I tapped the many sites (Sparkfun, Instructables, Stack-Exchange, etc.) that explained how \"makers\" like me could learn to build hardware, and within 12 months I had a cloud-controlled hardware system complete enough to conduct my first pilot project. After we completed the pilot and collected all of the usability data, it was clear that \"version 2\" was going to be almost as much work to design/build as \"version 1!\" What these sites don't explain is how to build a hardware business! Undeterred, we pressed on. Version 2 took almost six more months! The product was starting to look pro and we were able to raise money to become a real company. A frustrating problem was that more people and money had almost no material impact on our ability to rapidly innovate hardware designs. We would think, \"Oh, if the product could do X, then it would be awesome.\" We knew X wouldn't see the light of day for almost a year, and there was a growing pile of X-like feature requests. It was depressing. Right around this time, my wife asked me to clear out of the home shop so that our boys could have a big play space. That meant hauling to work a CNC mill and a bunch of tools. That same week we learned of our first opportunity to create an \"add on\" product to our system, but we didn't have 6-12 months to do it. The opportunity would disappear in 8-12 weeks. We went online to see if it was possible to create sophisticated SMT/SMD circuit boards on a CNC mill, and sure enough we found a tutorial for our exact mill. We hired a skilled machinist, and within two weeks we could generate a completed PCB/A in just a few days. At that time we used off-the-shelf enclosures that were expensive and ugly (to us by now). We decided to create a formal design studio and hired our design consultant to run it. He devised a system where we could build new enclosures in a CNC mill following a layer-by-layer stack-up process. This enabled us to create fairly complex, but good looking enclosures with features, like undercuts, that you normally can't create from a single, milled part. Eventually, we developed our design process further to incorporate folded steel to greatly increase our iteration and manufacture rate while bringing costs way down. The tooling we used is not expensive: likely you could recreate our entire shop for $50K, and a light-duty version of it for less than $25K. Over the course of a year we formalized this process into a set of internal processes and documentation we called ZeroDiff. Through these process improvements we were able to complete production-ready hardware design revisions in as little as 48 hours. Working with local vendor/partners we were able to source all of the components to make tens of thousands of sophisticated radio control systems entirely in our downtown Oakland office. Now to Share it \u00b6 We had always intended to share our ZeroDiff process, but there just never seemed to be a good way (or time) to do it. All of the company docs were trapped in Confluence, which is not a particularly great system (not forkable, and now long on tooth). We really wanted this stuff to live in github, so that the community could share and possibly grow it without a lot of inter-organization coordination. Once we found mkdocs, it seemed clear this was the right way forward. A Work In Progress \u00b6 Because we only lightly edited these documents as we extracted them, they still may have the company stink on them. They might also be incomplete, because it's just not possible to collect all the weird loose ends from our company system since it was spread across Confluence, Google Docs, Email and Jira. This is just a starting point, and we hope we all can grow this together. ZeroDiff is not for Everyone \u00b6 We find that about 20% of the folks who hear about ZeroDiff \"get it\" and would like to embrace it. There's no mission to sell ZeroDiff, and we recognize there's many ways to reach the same end in product development. It's just a simple idea, and never really should be complex. There's a certain kind of product auteur nowadays who seem to do it all, and they're fascinating no matter what process they follow. Make it Local Wherever Local is \u00b6 Finally, probably the most important part of ZeroDiff is that you can design and build a product close to the user wherever they are . This is the thing that excites me the most because we believe it unlocks a world where low-volume, high-value products can thrive **. ** For the non-economic definitions of value: basically when there's no money in making people's lives better.","title":"Why ZeroDiff?"},{"location":"about/why/#why-zerodiff","text":"In 2011 I started a side-project that would become my next startup: an innovative, low-power, cloud-controlled IoT device applied to e-commerce logistics and automation.

Richard Neutra This quote is beautiful because he generously allows the design to originate from the end users rather than a design \"school of thought.\" One could argue that certain design thoughts represent a timelessness that stands apart from the end users, but even Bauhaus, as taught by Bruno Taut, embraced Humane Functionalism.","title":"Mid-Century Designers"},{"location":"design/essential_user_task/","text":"First Principles \u00b6 \u201cI think it is important to reason from first principles rather than by analogy.

Since there will be tons of continuous design choices along the entire product gradient, you want to make sure the most important decisions come from a careful, measured process. For this reason we invented the \"Everyday Sprint\" that teams could run regularly with low burden. Typically we follow these steps: Choose one or two central tasks that need design thought. One or more people conduct an ethnographic study with these central questions in mind (a half-day usually). The sprint leader selects members to join the design sprint, and shares the \"cooked\" study data and schedules 60-90 minutes to run the sprint. The day before, the sprint leader secures materials for the sprint (stickies, pencils, erasers, timers, and the room). Just before the sprint, the leader preps the room: Write the essential user task on the whiteboard. Write the 1-2 design sprint central questions. Partition the board into three design story classifications columns: essential, uncertain and ideal. Sharpens all the pencils, arranges the materials and chooses the teams. Working in teams of 2-3 people, you allow 30 minutes for each team to rapidly and simultaneously create design stories that address the selected central question on the board. At the end of 30 minutes the teams work together to read their stories aloud and the group votes if the story is \"essential, uncertain or ideal.\" The sprint leader sticks the voted stories in the correct column, allowing for (near) duplicates by stacking the duplicates. Repeat this process for all the central questions on the board (generally you do not want more than two). At the end of the design sprint, the sprint leader and product (or feature) owner should have a complete set of design stories categorized by how essential they are to the user process under consideration.

The steps for kick-off are: Send an announce email to rnd@codeshelf.com Schedule Kick-off meeting Ensure that the Current and Planned Hardware Releases page in the ZeroDiff Process Home page is accurate for the device (and any related projects or sub-assemblies) at every step of this process document. Print this page and make sure it follows the device through the development cycle. Always document while working, and always work with a pen. For information about how an object is designed, reference In Action Product Design Process. For information regarding Testing Criteria, reference Basic Hardware Testing Criteria. Step 1: Create Design Artifacts \u00b6 The first step of the design and manufacture of mechanicals is to create all of the relevant design and production artifacts (files). We are currently using Solidworks, Rhino, or Illustrator to design Mechanicals. Production documentation (drawings) is executed in Solidworks and output as PDF. Derivative CAD format files (those sent to vendors) are SLDPRT, STEP or EPS, depending on manufacturing process. Upload relevant Solidworks files to GrabCAD Be sure that the Solidworks files stay synced to GrabCAD in order to preserve change history Step 2: Create a Prototype (Designer, ProtoMgr) \u00b6 To validate the design we produce an in-house prototype when possible. This is a somewhat lightweight process and is not a tagged GitHub release, because there may be many of them. If no prior Github repository exists for the project in question, file a JIRA Service Request with DevOps and request one with the appropriate project name. The engineer commits the CAD derivative files and PDF drawings to GitHub. If the assembly requires a BOM the engineer creates a prototype BOM and mails it to the prototype shop manager. Hand off the document package to the Prototype Shop. The prototype shop manager schedules the build and coordinates with the production manager to acquire any missing BOM components. The prototype shop converts the STEP or SLDPRT file into gcode using the HSMWorks plugin for Solidworks. The prototype shop makes the parts. The prototype shop assembles the housing and delivers it to the HWTE. In the absence of the HWTE, prototypes are delivered to the design engineer. When mechanical devices cannot be prototyped in-house: Email production files to the ProdMgr along with requested turnaround time and quantities. ProdMgr will place RFQs and PO. Prototypes will be made at a CMS. Prototypes will be delivered to the HWTE. In the absence of the HWTE, prototypes are delivered to the design engineer. Step 3: Test the Prototype (HWTE, Designer) \u00b6 The HWTE and design engineer create a complete template object (built to the design intent) to test against. The HWTE and design engineer run all of the relevant tests set out in the design process to validate that the prototype is correct. Refer to the Basic Hardware Testing Criteria google doc. The document should be printed and reviewed with a pen. If the HWTE approves the device for production then proceed to step 4, otherwise go back to step 1. Hand off the document package to the Designer. Step 4: Create Release Candidate (RC) Artifacts (Designer) \u00b6 For a mechanical/housing manufacturing run, the release package contains the following documents, as appropriate to the design and type of manufacturing process (in other words, not all designs will require each of the file types below). The filenames derive from the base product ID, e.g. POSCON.XXXXXX CNC Manufacturing typical file sets File Example Prod/Design Folder Drawing POSCON.FACE.dxf Production Drawing POSCON.FACE.pdf Production Vector File POSCON.FACE.eps Production (if lasercut) Solidworks File POSCON.FACE.SLDPRT Production (if CNC) STEP file POSCON.FACE.STEP Production (if CNC) Lasercutting File typical file set: File Example Prod/Design Folder Drawing POSCON.FACE.pdf Production Vector File POSCON.FACE.dxf Production Vector File P2X142 POSCON.FACE.eps Production (if lasercut) README POSCON.FACE.README.docx Production (if lasercut): Lasercut production file naming convention: SheetSize X Part yield per sheet PART.NAME.eps PRODUCTION 3D Printed File typical file set: File Example Prod/Design Folder Drawing POSCON.FACE.stl Production Drawing POSCON.FACE.pdf Production Bill of Materials, Engineering Change Order file set: File Example Prod/Design Folder BOM POSCON.MECH.BOM.xlsx Production ECO POSCON.FACE.eco.xlsx Production A typical release package would include some combination of: DXF, AI or EPS Vector file for laser cut parts Specific production files for current vendor (eg - Ponoko laser cut layout and ReadMe file) Stereolithography File (STL) SLDPRT, STEP and/or IGES File PDF Drawing File Engineering Change Order (ECO) Bill Of Materials (BOM) Editing ECOs: If changing the design of a previously released object, best practice is to update and commit the ECO as the object is being designed. If working on a new production object, follow these steps: Open the New ECO Template (link here) The Commit Message field for a new production object should read \"Initial Commit, v1.0\" for a new project. Create a column in the ECO for each part being released by us to the right of the MISC Changes column in order to record future changes. Copy the Commit Message field in the ECO and paste it to the Commit Message field in Github before committing the ECO. If working on a previously released production object, follow these steps: Record changes to each part in its individual column. If adding a new part, add a column and name it \"Part_Name Changes\". If deleting a part, note that in the part's column. Do not delete the column. Copy the change messages into the Commit Message field in the ECO. If the message is \"none\", ignore it. Copy the Commit Message field in the ECO and paste it to the Commit Message field in Github before committing the ECO. Print drawings Highlight changes Examine the changes for errors and make any needed corrections These changes should also be reflected in the commit messages in Git. If there is a design change to any part in the assembly, the entire assembly needs to increment, but other drawings in the same assembly that are separate and not changed do not need to increment. Any levels above the re-versioned assembly will also need to increment. Ensure that drawings made for production (other than laser cutting) comply with ANSI Standards: Limit dimensions should be used on all individually dimensioned toleranced parts. The Baseline dimensioning system should be used to locate toleranced surfaces to avoid an accumulation of tolerance. All dimensions should be given in decimals except drill sizes, fillets and rounds, and standard fasteners. Each dimension should be given clearly so that it can be interpreted in only one way Dimensions should not be duplicated or the same information given in two different ways and no dimensions should be given except those needed to produce or inspect the part. Dimensions should be given to finished surfaces or important center lines, in preference to rough surfaces, whenever possible. Dimensions should be so given that it will not be necessary for the machinist to calculate, scale, or assume any dimension. Dimensions should be given in the view where the shape is best shown. Dimensions should be placed in the views where the features dimensioned are shown true shape. Dimensions should not be placed on a view unless it eliminates long extension lines and makes the dimension clearer. Dimensions applying to two adjacent views should be placed between the views if possible. The longer dimensions should be placed outside all intermediate dimensions so that dimension lines will not cross extension lines. Do not force workers to assume that a feature is centered. Provide a location dimension. Non-toleranced detail dimensions may be chained if necessary, or avoid a complete chain of detail dimensions by omitting one and providing an overall dimension. Dimension lines should be spaced uniformly (approximately \u215c\u201d apart). For a complete ANSI checklist, refer to ANSI Dimensioning Guidelines v1.1. Step 5: Commit the Release Candidate Package to GitHub \u00b6 When working with RC files, best practices dictate that all files being created, edited and committed to GitHub be managed from the same place to keep the workflow consistent. Commit the above files to GitHub. When doing so, observe that no \"lockfiles\" are entered into the repository when a commit is made. (These are created when saving XLS files with LibreOffice and look like *.xls#. Right-click on these in Github and choose the \"Ignore .XLS#\" Be sure you're using the ignore command on the correct file. Diff the files in Github in order to determine which files have been changed Examine changed files for errors Correct any errors found Tag the commit ID as a Release Candidate (RC). E.g. V1.1-RC1 Descriptions of changes that have been committed need to be included in the commit message. Copy commit messages between the RC release and the final production release into the ECO. The RC tag should increment (RC1, RC2) until the object is approved for production and released with the appropriate production version tag (E.g. V1.1). Step 6: Release Checklist \u00b6 Download and print all files in the RC package from GitHub. All files in the RC package must be checked against a printed Checklist: Mechanical Production Review v1.4. The document should be printed and reviewed with a pen. Any drawings to be released to CMs must be checked by the HTWE or in-house ANSI domain expert. If changes need to be made, go back to Step 4. Step 7: Build RC Articles (ProdMgr & HWTE) \u00b6 Once a part releases as RC, we send the release package to the CMS for a request to quote for manufacture. RC articles are not needed if the same outside CM has manufactured the prototype, and the same design has been approved for production with no changes. If either the design or manufacturing process changes from the approved prototype, RC articles are needed. Email the ProdMgr to request an RC build along with requested turnaround time and quantity. Hand off the document package to the Production Manager. ProdMgr will place RFQs and PO. RC articles will be made at a CMS. The CMS is not allowed to make any changes to this package without first looping back to Codeshelf to obtain an approved ECO. If we receive an ECR from the CMS, we review it and decide if we will approve the change. If we agree to approve the change, then we capture that change in the appropriate documents (BOM, ECO, etc.) and re-release the product with these changes, incrementing the tag. Hand off the document package to the Hardware Test Engineer when RC Articles are complete and delivered. RC articles will be delivered to the HWTE. In the absence of the HWTE, RC articles are delivered to the design engineer. When the device comes back from the CMS, it gets assembled by the prototype shop (if not already assembled by the outside CMS). ProdMgr checks whether CMS has made any modifications to the design. If so, the design needs to be revised and re-versioned. Step 8: Test and Validate RC Articles (HWTE & Designer) \u00b6 RC articles must be approved by the HWTE / designer in order to release for production. Hand off the document package to the Hardware Test Engineer. Print the Basic Hardware Testing Criteria and review with a pen. Run all of the relevant tests set out in the design process to validate that the article is correct. If the HWTE approves the device for production then proceed to step 9, otherwise go back to step 4. Step 9: Release Tag (Designer) Hand off the document package to the designer/engineer. When RC articles are proven good and approved for production: Tag the final commit with with the appropriate production version number. Github automatically notifies ProdMgr of the release. Hand off the document package to the Production Manager. Step 10: Release Announcement (ProdMgr) \u00b6 Issue a release announcement Update the Current and Planned Hardware Releases and Products in need of release documents. The item is then cleared for ongoing production. Step 11: Post Release Review (ProdMgr) \u00b6 Review the release process with the Engineer Change the release process document as needed Change the release checklists as needed","title":"MechE Dev"},{"location":"hardware/mech_eng/#step-0-kick-off-development-cycle","text":"The kick-off is essential to inform everyone that the object is now in-flight for another development cycle.

The engineer commits the CAD derivative files and PDF drawings to GitHub. If the assembly requires a BOM the engineer creates a prototype BOM and mails it to the prototype shop manager. Hand off the document package to the Prototype Shop. The prototype shop manager schedules the build and coordinates with the production manager to acquire any missing BOM components. The prototype shop converts the STEP or SLDPRT file into gcode using the HSMWorks plugin for Solidworks. The prototype shop makes the parts.

If working on a new production object, follow these steps: Open the New ECO Template (link here) The Commit Message field for a new production object should read \"Initial Commit, v1.0\" for a new project. Create a column in the ECO for each part being released by us to the right of the MISC Changes column in order to record future changes. Copy the Commit Message field in the ECO and paste it to the Commit Message field in Github before committing the ECO. If working on a previously released production object, follow these steps: Record changes to each part in its individual column. If adding a new part, add a column and name it \"Part_Name Changes\". If deleting a part, note that in the part's column. Do not delete the column. Copy the change messages into the Commit Message field in the ECO. If the message is \"none\", ignore it. Copy the Commit Message field in the ECO and paste it to the Commit Message field in Github before committing the ECO. Print drawings Highlight changes Examine the changes for errors and make any needed corrections These changes should also be reflected in the commit messages in Git. If there is a design change to any part in the assembly, the entire assembly needs to increment, but other drawings in the same assembly that are separate and not changed do not need to increment.

The steps for kick-off are: Nominate a \"person in charge\" to manage this object through the process. Send an announce email to the development group. Schedule kick-off meeting Create a JIRA epic for the object. E.g. \"CHECON-PCBA-New Display\" Create relevant JIRA stories Go to the hardware release page and update the relevant information for the device and any relevant sub-component projects: Current and Planned Hardware Releases Print this page and make sure it follows the device through the development cycle. Read with a pen! Step 1: Create Design Artifacts (Engineer) \u00b6 The first step to the design and manufacture of a PCB/A is to create all of the relevant design and production artifacts (files). EagleCAD schematic The first step for any new design is to capture it as an EagleCAD schematic. This is the architectural design document of the circuit. The schematic contains all of the parts in the design and is the central source of the BOM for any design by capturing component annotations. (Later we'll get these annotations from Octopart). The format for naming our designs is to use a six-character code like POSCTL and then the design files will be POSCTL.sch and POSCTL.brd, etc. EagleCAD layout Once the schematic is complete we layout the physical board in what will become the final PCB. This layout includes the board stack-up, because each layer of the stackup is a layer in EagleCAD. Once the layout is complete, EagleCAD can generate the Gerber files, Excellon Drill files, Centroid files and BOM for the design that are suitable to manufacture the board to completion. For this reason any version of the EagleCAD file stored in git should always be able to generate the master files needed to manufacture the part. Step 2: Run ERC / DRC checks against manufacturer capabilities file \u00b6 EagleCAD has the ability to create a design rules check file, and it should match your manufacturer's capabilities for the kind of board you want to make. It's a good idea to have both a \"standard\" and \"advanced\" DRC file. The standard file should be for everything that's easy to run (and somewhat cheap). The advanced file should be for when you have tight tolerances, for example when you need narrow vias. Because we are able to cut our own PCBs on a mill, we generally use \"standard\" to match the mill's capability since it's usually much looser than the \"low cost\" option at most fab houses. Advanced designs are usually beyond the capability of our mill, or require the machine operator to make special allowances for end mills. (Generally we do not run 0.025mm end mills because they break easily and are somewhat finicky.) Step 3: Create a Prototype Release \u00b6 To validate the design we produce an in-house prototype. This is a somewhat lightweight process where the engineer commits the Eagle schematic and board files to git. This is not a tagged release, because there may be many of them. The engineer commits the Eagle schematic and board files. The engineer creates a PCB blank template and mails it to the prototype shop manager. The engineer creates a prototype BOM and mails is to the prototype shop manager. The prototype shop manager schedules the board build and coordinates with the production manager to acquire any missing BOM components. The prototype shop converts the Eagle board file into gcode using the \"board blank\" template. The prototype shop cuts the PCB. The prototype shop assembles the PCB, that potentially includes new enclosures and mechanicals, and delivers it to the HWTE. When boards cannot be prototyped in-house: Email production files to the ProdMgr along with requested turnaround time and quantities. RFQs will be placed. Prototypes will be made at a CMS. Any sub-assembly which versions separately can be released (to prototype or production) without releasing the other components of the assembly. Step 4: Test the Prototype \u00b6 The HWTE runs all of the relevant tests to validate that the prototype is correct. Program and test the device in the manufacturing/test jig. Run the MAT, if possible. Run the device in the AMT (units tests and E2E tests) If the HWTE approves the device for production, then proceed to step 4, otherwise go back to step 1. Step 5: Create the Pre-Release/Release Package (Engineer) \u00b6 There are steps to manufacturing a complete PCB/A that the EagleCAD files do not capture. These include how to resolve ambiguity in the silkscreen (when parts are very close together), any special instructions, UL documentation, PCB stackup notes such as fiberglass type (eg. FR4, copper weights, etc.). Note on fab files from the CMS: Specify board material, surface finish (pads), electrical (nickel, gold), mask, thickness, already have a drill file, net list testing by fab shop is required. Controlled impedance is not standard \u2013 if you don\u2019t want it, don\u2019t include in notes. Include UL related notes for agency approvals \u2013 it\u2019s standard for fab shops. We should have UL in drawings and require it in boards. Need for UL has to do with plugging into the wall and certifying for safety. Also, there are specific components that need to be UL rated. All components are UL certified. If we don\u2019t specify, we don\u2019t have a document trail and can get dinged if anybody asks. Term is something about UL flammability rating as an etch on the board. For a PCB/A manufacturing run, the release package contains the following documents. The file names derive from the base product ID, e.g. POSCON. From that all PCB/A files end in POSCON.PCB. File Example Prod/Design Folder Schematic POSCON.PCB.sch Design Board POSCON.PCB.brd Design Board Outline POSCON.PCB.FAB Production\\Gerber Top Copper POSCON.PCB.LAY1 Production\\Gerber Inner Copper 1 POSCON.PCB.LAY2 Production\\Gerber Inner Copper 2 POSCON.PCB.LAY3 Production\\Gerber Bottom Copper POSCON.PCB.LAY4 Production\\Gerber Bottom Soldermask POSCON.PCB.SMB Production\\Gerber Top Soldermask POSCON.PCB.SMT Production\\Gerber Bottom Solderpaste POSCON.PCB.SPB Production\\Gerber Top Solderpaste POSCON.PCB.SPT Production\\Gerber Top Silkscreen POSCON.PCB.SST Production\\Gerber Bottom Silkscreen POSCON.PCB.SSB Production\\Gerber Excellon Drill File POSCON.PCB.drd Production\\Gerber Centroid File POSCON.PCB_centroid.csv Production\\Gerber BOM POSCON.PCB.BOM.xlsx Production Fabrication Notes POSCON.PCB.FAB.txt Production Assembly File POSCON.PCB.ASSY.txt Production Test File POSCON.PCB.TEST.txt Production ECO POSCON.PCB.ECO.xlsx Production Step 6: Commit the Pre-Release Package to Git (Engineer) \u00b6 Commit the above files to github. Tag the commit ID (the git commit SHA1) as a release candidate (RC). E.g. V1.1-RC1 Step 7: Release Checklist (Engineer, HWTE and ProdMgr) \u00b6 All files in the Release Candidate repository must be checked against a printed Release Checklist and a printed copy of this document for completeness and accuracy. Checklist: Codeshelf EE Design Process and Release Step 8: Release Tag (Engineer) \u00b6 This step includes a complete review of the design and BOM. When the checklist is passed, the Git repository will be tagged as a release. Step 9: Arena (ProdMgr) \u00b6 At this point we have an object that is manufacturable and if it passes all pre-production tests it will never, ever change again. For this reason it is now safe to enter all pre-release package files into the Arena database before continuing the release process. Reference the Arena process document at: Step 10: Build First Articles (ProdMgr) \u00b6 Once a part releases prior to manufacture we send the release package to the CMS for a request to quote/manufacture. The CMS is not allowed to make any changes to this package, including vendor or part substitutions, without first looping back to Codeshelf to obtain an ECO. The most common case is that the CMS requests permission to swap parts or vendors for passives. When we receive the ECR from the CMS, we review it and decide if we will approve the change. If we agree to approve the change then we capture that change into the appropriate documents (BOM, ECO, etc.) and re-release the product with these changes. When the device comes back from the fab, it gets assembled by the prototype shop (if not already assembled by the outside CMS). Check whether CMS has any modifications to the design. If so, the design needs to be revised and re-versioned. Step 11: Test and Validate First Articles (HWTE) \u00b6 Program and test the device in the manufacturing/test jig. Run the MAT, if possible. Run the device in the AMT (units tests and E2E tests) If approved for production then the proceed to step 12, otherwise proceed to step 1. Step 12: Release Announcement (ProdMgr) \u00b6 If the First Articles are proven good, a release announcement will be issued, the Current and Planned Hardware Releases document will be updated, and the item will be cleared for further production. Step 13: Post Release Review (ProdMgr) \u00b6 Review the release process with the Engineer Change the release process document as needed Change the release checklists as needed","title":"PCB/A Dev"},{"location":"hardware/pcba/#step-0-kick-off-development-cycle","text":"The kick-off is essential to inform everyone that the object is now in-flight for another development cycle.

Facts about GrabCAD: \u00b6 GrabCAD's position is that 2D drawings are dead, and they don't support them in any way other than making it possible to package PDFs along with 3D files when you get ready to submit them to a manufacturer via their Partner Spaces feature. There is no \"annotation layer\" in GrabCAD, nor do they make it possible to edit drawings in any of their tools. I have this in email from GrabCAD themselves. They do have a 3D view with annotations you can add, but as someone who's worked in a machine shop I sincerely question their usefulness (machine shops are likely to request PDFs for estimating purposes whether we use this tool or not). Very often prototyping machinists simply print and mark up the drawings. The Partner Spaces could be useful, but all they do is provide a secure landing page with a download link for manufacturing partners. They provide versioning, but it's not very flexible and doesn't work the way we do. It literally appends a version number to each save you upload to GrabCAD Workbench. It doesn't give us the option to use our own version number and revision scheme. Also, there is a provision for creating BOMs. Also not terribly flexible, nor does it have very many features that we need. What it does is kick out a CSV file with the names of the files you've uploaded, with data about those. It won't filter the filetype out of the name when it creates the CSV. It would take me longer to hand-edit one of these (I did try!) into a workable * BOM than it would be to simply copy-paste or work from a pre-built template of our making. The things it does do well Keeping track of historical versions of a file (every save is captured). However, we already do a form of this with Git. I haven't yet looked into what happens when you work out of the Git folder with Solidworks yet, but I suspect it'll work fine. Allowing for visually checking differences between two versions of a 3D CAD file (Github doesn't do this - yet) The things we were hoping to automate with it, BOMs and 2D drawings, are either not possible or more work than they're worth. Facts about Solidworks: \u00b6 There are a couple of tools that could help us work more efficiently, but they are unlikely to have a huge impact on the amount of time that we spend making drawings to the degree that it's worth slowing down the modeling process. Also, they have up-front setup times that we will need to be conscious of. It's possible to set up Solidworks to create BOMs that can be exported along with the drawings. This is probably a one-time endeavor, and will result in something that we can use over and over again. I'm not sure how long it would take to set up, but's unlikely to less than one day. It's possible to build Solidworks models in such a way as to start the process of adding annotations while one is working in the model, long before the drawings are started. Although I haven't tried this technique out yet, my suspicion is that working in this way will slow down the modeling process enough to mitigate any time savings we might get from it on the back end (i.e. annotating and preparing 2D drawings after the modeling is done). Things that should go into current process: \u00b6 BOMs should be created and maintained from Solidworks (see risks/benefits below) Examine drawings in terms of what has changed, only test against what has changed STEP ADDED Bring all CAD files together into the same place (GrabCAD?) and practice better & more disciplined data hygiene STEP ADDED Use Github at the point of file creation to reduce shuttle time between machines STEP ADDED Upload files to GrabCAD STEP ADDED Diff files and folders STEP ADDED For discussion and potential adoption: \u00b6 MECH Release Checklist Google Form Cost Minimal Benefits speed up and simplify the checklist process by gating out irrelevant steps in the process Risks \"Read With A Pen\" and \"No Gating\" are requirements of our current process.

You run automated monkey tests against each commit using the continuous integration (CI) system. The alternative, perhaps most common way to accomplish this kind of testing, is human-scripted testing. Don't do that! Human-driven, scripted testing is mindless and boooring , and the more someone runs them, the more numb they become. This is a recipe for tests that hardly ever get run, and when they do get run, the effort is generally perfunctory and sloppy. Even your first design iteration should be testable \u00b6 When you engage in any design, you must start with the question: \"what's testable about this design?\" The right way to test is automation: continuous integration, unit and end-to-end tests. You'll never get to automated testing unless the tests are part of the design process. A side benefit of doing this in the design process is that when you send a revision to mass production, your vendor partners have a way to validate their work as part of the QA/acceptance testing. (You, really, really, really don't want to race around trying to create some kind of manufacturing acceptance test just before manufacture because it will force you to redesign the PCB and that will take almost as much work as the original development!) Test criteria fall into four broad categories: \u00b6 Usability \u00b6 The whole reason to follow the ZeroDiff process is to rapidly iterate on your design assumptions. The design stories that flow out of the sprints should represent the base criteria that validates if the design meets user need. As soon as a prototype emerges from the shop, the test team needs to validate the prototype against these stories. Survivability \u00b6 One problem with the \"works-like/looks-like\" development model is there is no way to know how difficult it will be to design a production version that can survive contact with users. Breaking the production process into two phases like this will take more total development hours, and it creates a lot of uncertainty about how long it will actually take to get to market. Manufacturability \u00b6 Each time the prototype team produces a design iteration, they should perform a design-for-manufacture (DMF) review. Each iteration is a chance for the production team to inform the design team of ways to improve costs, simplicity, reliability and quality. One nice thing about the ZeroDiff process is that small changes like this are easy to digest, so the two teams can make a lot of progress without conflict. Reliability \u00b6 Probably the most unnerving part of hardware development are transient field failures. E.g. glitches, reboots, freezes, bricking or random weirdness in the user experience. The best way to defend against transient failures is to force the combined firmware and hardware through automated testing for every commit. Steps to get to AMT \u00b6 Burn-in/Manufacture Jigs \u00b6 Probably the easiest way to start down the road to AMT is to start with a test/flash jig for any new design. Resist the temptation to simply place a JTAG/SWD header on the PCB that fits your programming pod. It will be difficult for an outside vendor partner to reach any meaningful scale if they require access to a programming pod on the manufacturing floor. Even if you don't have the ability to fabricate a jig now, the presence of the flash/debug bus as test points means you can more easily automate this for production later without having to redesign the board. Whether the device ever reaches scaled production or not, it costs almost nothing to add this capability in the beginning. Test Harness and Test Points \u00b6 Closely related to burn-in jigs are test points. Any I/O, button, switch, sensor or communication bus should have a corresponding test point (pad) accessible somewhere on the PCB. These should all be on the same side, probably on what would be the \"bottom\" if the device has a strong user-facing side. The test harness can use pogo-pins to reach these test points. Even if you don't have the capability to fabricate a test harness/jig, adding these test points now allows you easily incorporate a test harness later without having to redesign the board. Eventually you want these test points to drive automated tests that simulate user behaviors to test on-board subsystems like communications or sensor readings. The same automated, scripted tests you use in AMT work for manufacturing validation and QA. The assembly line worker should be able to push the completed device into a harness and press a button that flashes the device and runs a validation battery that results in a go/no-go indication for the assembly worker. Scripted Development Environment \u00b6 Almost all firmware development toolchains now support scripted development. Embrace this early and integrate it into a continuous integration tool like TeamCity. This is not hard to do, and the benefits are enormous. Once the scripted testing is in place, your development team has a convenient place to hang firmware unit tests. Scripted testing is also a good place to hang automated monkey tests. Once you have even one of these automated tests, it's much easier for the team to add subsequent tests. Report Bugs as Unit Tests \u00b6 A good QA and development team is able to express bugs as unit or E2E tests that fail. Having a place to add these tests to automated testing means that you can get coverage against regressions or closely related failures.","title":"Automated Monkey Tests"},{"location":"test/monkey/#automated-monkey-testing-amt","text":"A continuous and complete simulation of user interactions against a design. You run automated monkey tests against each commit using the continuous integration (CI) system. The alternative, perhaps most common way to accomplish this kind of testing, is human-scripted testing. Don't do that! Human-driven, scripted testing is mindless and boooring , and the more someone runs them, the more numb they become. This is a recipe for tests that hardly ever get run, and when they do get run, the effort is generally perfunctory and sloppy.","title":"Automated Monkey Testing (AMT)"},{"location":"test/monkey/#even-your-first-design-iteration-should-be-testable","text":"When you engage in any design, you must start with the question: \"what's testable about this design?\" The right way to test is automation: continuous integration, unit and end-to-end tests. You'll never get to automated testing unless the tests are part of the design process. A side benefit of doing this in the design process is that when you send a revision to mass production, your vendor partners have a way to validate their work as part of the QA/acceptance testing. (You, really, really, really don't want to race around trying to create some kind of manufacturing acceptance test just before manufacture because it will force you to redesign the PCB and that will take almost as much work as the original development!)","title":"Even your first design iteration should be testable"},{"location":"test/monkey/#test-criteria-fall-into-four-broad-categories","text":"","title":"Test criteria fall into four broad categories:"},{"location":"test/monkey/#usability","text":"The whole reason to follow the ZeroDiff process is to rapidly iterate on your design assumptions.
