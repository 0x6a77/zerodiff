# Make fewer things that are more valuable

> Good design is good business.

> Eliot Noyes

A good, iterative design process will identify early which objects have "pull" and which do not. It's important to kill mediocre or bad product before it gets far into the process. Invest instead in making just a few objects that are great. The only way to learn this stuff early is to iterate rapidly and measure, measure, measure. ZeroDiff and a good design methodology allows you to run these tests quickly. It's true that some mediocre product concepts might flip to great because small design changes can have chaotic impacts on product value. As a small organization you do not have the luxury to chase these leprechauns. It's wiser to focus on the products that demonstrate excellence early in the process.
