### Github for design docs and artifacts

We discovered that github was waaay better for managing designs, builds, BOMs, fab documents and related ephemera. Formal BOM managers and ERP systems *suck*. Seriously - you have no idea. Not only are they trapped in the best tech 1995 has to offer, they're overly complex and stupid expensive. Even when you hire dedicated staff to run this stuff, they struggle to keep it relevant. We found keeping the designers, engineers, QA and build teams all on the same toolchain also kept the close.
