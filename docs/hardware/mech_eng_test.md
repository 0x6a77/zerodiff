## Design Test

* Do screws back out?
* If special tools are needed, do we have enough of them? Torx, Allen, etc?
* During assembly
* Does it feel solid?
* If there are points of weakness, where are they?
* Anything obviously wrong should be noted
* Do the buttons actuate? Anything interfering with them?
* Static Electricity testing
* Electrical shorts through housing?
* Do cables fit securely?
* Do they break contact?
* Does the housing interfere with cable connections?
* Squeeze the device and look for any changes in behavior or fit/finish
* Shake the device, listen for loose PCB or other parts
* If the device has mounting affordances, mount it
* How much force is required to remove it?
* How much force is needed to mount it?
* Can it be twisted off of the mounting surface/area?
* How do finishes hold up with abrasion?
* Is the device easily cleanable?
* Fingerprints?
* Do housing components assemble/align well?
* Has intended design symmetry been preserved?
* Are corners broken? Any obvious burrs?
* Are fillets present?
* Holes in housing for connectors
* What is the appropriate torque application for screws? Are electric screwdrivers not advised?

## CAD Sanity Check
 
## Prototyping

* Have we made sure that all parts are final production units and not holdovers from prototyping?

## Vendor Acceptance/QA

## Tolerances and Standards

* Measure Against Drawings, check against Codeshelf standard tolerances (on drawings)
    * Thickness
    * Height
    * Length
    * Width

* Finish Examination
    * Any surface finish callouts on drawings should be checked against finished parts
    * Note any obvious mechanical flaws on mating surfaces
    * Note cracks, flaws or imperfections
    * Corners rounded/broken? Check for sharp edges
    * Look for mars, scratches

* Mechanical Fit and Alignment
    * Test-fit mating parts and examine for alignment issues
* Assembly Tests
    * Assemble fully
    * Tighten screws
    * Check for gaps in mating parts
    * Housing ports/holes for connectors
    * How close is the fit around the cable?
    * Does the cable break contact?
* Functional Tests
    * Buttons
        * Do buttons function as intended, mechanically?
        * Are they aligned in their openings?
* Screens
    * Is the screen aligned with the edges of the housing?
    * Are all pixels visible?
* Antennae
* Screws/fasteners
    * Do screws back out?
    * What happens when you overtighten them?
* Endurance Tests
    * Drop Test
    * Drop device from the height it is normally used from/mounted at
* Shake Test
    * Vigorously shake the device and listen for rattles and other sounds, note them
* Cable pull/Twist
    * Insert cables and pull them out. 
    * Note how much force is needed
    * Note any breakage or loose parts
* Squeeze Test
    * Squeeze the assembled device with your hands and look for gaps in the housing, note any sounds or breakage
