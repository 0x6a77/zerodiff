## ZeroDiff Process Documentation

These are the process documents we created and follow to run the ZeroDiff process at our company.

### A Simple Philosophy

>If you maintain zero difference between prototype and production designs, as you rapidly iterate, you can mass produce any revision.

### Corollary

>Always manufacture prototype and production designs on the same tooling - **always**.

By running the ZeroDiff process we found that we could rapidly iterate on hardware designs like we do with software. We are able to manufacture production-ready designs in as little as 48 hours.
